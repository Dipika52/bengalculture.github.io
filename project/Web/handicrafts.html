Men’s Dresses:&nbsp;&nbsp;
The traditional dress of Bengali men is dhoti. The top or kurta that is paired with dhoti is called panjabi.

In earlier times and especially during British Era, the dhotis were synonymous with white color. However, these days, to add a twist to the attire the dhoti is made available in number of attractive colors.
The panjabis or the kurtas are usually made of silk or cotton and run up to knee length.

The lungi happens to be another variation of the men’s costume. However that is more of an informal casual indoor wear.
<br>

 Saree is the signature traditional attire for the women in West Bengal. The saree captures the very essence of the culturally infused state West Bengal is. Even the saree draping style of Bengali women is quite distinct and has become more of a distinguishing feature now. Sarees are primarily woven in cotton and silk which have been named chiefly after their weaving techniques. The traditional weavers or Tantis of West Bengal are reputed worldwide because of the quality of fabric spun and their elaborate thread work. In various districts of Bengal like Murshidabad, Malda, Nadia, Birbhum, Bankura and Hooghly, different varieties of Sarees are woven with supreme efficiency and dedication.
